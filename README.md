# ISO-27001-2022-Guide
Guidance for ISMS implementation

ISO 27001:2022

Revised Name in ISO 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection

Other ISO Standards for reference:

* ISO/IEC 27003 -- implementation guidance;
* ISO/IEC 27031 -- resilience;
* ISO/IEC 27005 -- risk management guidance;
* ISO/IEC 27032 -- cybersecurity guidance;
* ISO/IEC 27033 -- network security guidance;
* ISO/IEC 27034 -- application security guidance;
* ISO/IEC 27035 -- incident management guidance

Purpose of ISO 27001: It provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving an ISMS.

**Establish:**

Establishing phase includes:

* Working with senior leadership, 
* Make sure that your organization has confirmation of the overall goals from top management
* Establish the objective for the ISMS
* Set budget and resource allocations accordingly

Be realistic about the scope of the project and the size and complexity of your organization

As you develop your ISMS plan, you’ll need to consider your business, industry, and related priorities and regulatory requirements. Once you’ve reviewed those standards, your ISMS scope will be set in line with those needs. Some methods a company can use to determine ISMS scope include using the risk ratings of systems (if they are classified by risk); identifying the highest priority information systems; and/or completing a formal information security-focused risk assessment to determine which systems should be included.

**Implement:**
Evaluate company assets and do a risk assessment over each category or type. When reviewing assets, include hardware (physical data storage, computers, phones), software, servers (physical and virtual), cloud services from third parties (vendors like Amazon Web Services, JIRA, banking, etc.), and customer information like PII and important client data. Anticipate what the loss or theft of these assets might result in, and create a risk management plan.
Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date asset inventory can be a game changer for many organizations and their risk and compliance teams. Having transparency into the assets owned and operated by the company makes it that much easier to set up appropriate safeguards for each.

**Integrate and Iterate:**
With needs, scope and budget determined, companies are now prepared to integrate their ISMS. In action, the ISMS uses the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. Representing an iterative usage model, the PDCA cycle is key for business processes that evolve over time. An ISMS is most effective when it is functioning, monitored, and then adjusted in a continual improvement process.
Integrating new ISMS controls and security requirements with existing systems, people, and processes can pose unanticipated challenges, not least of which including reluctance to execute the new controls. How teams communicate the purpose and intentions of the ISMS project to stakeholders and control owners can make the difference between success and failure.


Clause 4 Context of the Organization

4.1 Understanding the organization and its Context:

a. It requires organization to understand its own context and document how it might affect the information security management system (ISMS).
b. It shows that the organization have considered and addressed the internal risk and external risks that could directly impact the management system and its effectiveness.

Internal Issues:

Internal Issue	Example Internal Issue
People	Internally there are no resources trained or experienced in the delivery of ISO 27001.
Time	Key departments and key individuals need to invest significant time in implementing and managing the information security management system and its supporting controls.
Organisational Structure	The structure of the organisation currently does not fully support the information security management implementation and on-going management. Changes will be required.
Technologies	The company uses off the self, standard applications under license.
Availability of reliable, qualified and competent work force	There is strong competition in the market for resources for x technology.
Company Objectives	The company objectives are aligned with the information security objectives.

4.2 Identify the needs and expectations of interested parties

It shows that we have identified who our interested parties and what their requirements are on the information security management system.

a. Regulatory requirements
b. Information protection
c. Performance indexes
d. Security requirements (Access control, Asset management)
e. Transparency in business operating models
